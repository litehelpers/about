# About Brodysoft LiteHelpers

Brodysoft LiteHelpers is an organization by [@brodybits (Christopher J. Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) dedicated to supporting the sqlite plugin and and other related projects for enterprise mobile applications.

## Code of conduct

Described at: <http://contributor-covenant.org/>

## General discussion

General discussion will be held in the issues.

More description/discussion repositories may be added in the future if needed to separate some major areas of discussion, notes, and documentation. This idea is inspired by the [Node.js organization](https://github.com/nodejs/node).

While LiteHelpers is currently under the direction and moderation of [@brodybits](https://github.com/brodybits) discussions will be open and opposing viewpoints will be welcome.
